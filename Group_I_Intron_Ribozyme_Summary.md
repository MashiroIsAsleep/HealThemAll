## Clone 2 Sequence
### Primary Sequence:
```
GGCACCAAGCGAGAUGUAAUUUUUCGUUACUCUGGGUGUGGACAGGAGCCC
```

### Structural Features:
- **P3–P7 domain**:
  - Central to catalytic activity.
  - Contains the essential regions required for trans-esterification.
- **P9b Loop (a part of L9)**:
  - Sequence in **L9b** is complementary to the 5′ leader region of the substrate RNA.
  - **Base-pairing** stabilizes ribozyme-substrate interaction.

### Predicted Secondary Structure:
- Forms two stem-loops:
  - **P9a–L9a**
  - **P9b–L9b**
- **Key Modifications**:
  - Mutational analysis indicates that deletions of **P9a–L9a** reduce activity significantly (~7-fold).
  - Loop **L9b** is essential for substrate recognition through complementary base pairing.

## Clone 2.1 Sequence (Optimized Variant)
### Primary Sequence:
```
GGCAAUGAGCGAGAUGUAAUUUUUCGUUUAUCUGGGUGUGGACAGGUGCC
```

### Structural Features:
- **P9b region** underwent modifications:
  - Adjustments removed a deleterious bulged C residue.
  - Shortened loop for better efficiency in substrate binding.

### Enhanced Activity:
- Exhibits 3-fold higher activity than the wild-type ribozyme due to:
  - Improved substrate affinity.
  - Optimized secondary structure in **P9b**.

## Non-Central Structural Regions of the Ribozyme
### Overview:
The non-central parts of the ribozyme, such as the **P4–P6 domain**, play a stabilizing role rather than a direct catalytic role. Although they are not strictly essential for catalysis, they help maintain the structural integrity of the ribozyme under physiological conditions.

### Key Points:
1. **Peripheral Loops (e.g., L7.1, L8, L9)**:
   - Provide structural support to the catalytic core.
   - Variability in these regions allows modular engineering.
   - Insertions in these loops do not affect core catalysis but enhance overall activity.

2. **P4–P6 Domain**:
   - Involved in long-range interactions and structural stabilization.
   - Its deletion in mutants reduces catalytic efficiency, which can be partially compensated by magnesium ions or other stabilizers.

### Contributions:
- Stabilizes the conserved core (P3–P7 domain).
- Ensures proper folding for efficient catalysis.
- Facilitates substrate recognition by maintaining the ribozyme's tertiary structure.

## Visualization of Structural Regions
1. **P3–P7 Domain**:
   - Central catalytic module for the ribozyme.
   - Contains critical loops and helices for trans-esterification reactions.

2. **P9b Loop (L9b)**:
   - Responsible for substrate recognition.
   - Forms base pairs with the substrate RNA, essential for activity.

3. **Peripheral Regions**:
   - Enhance the catalytic activity by stabilizing the core.
   - Allow modular engineering for improved or altered functions.
